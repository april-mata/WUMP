    <h2> As you click on the button, the screen goes black and the computer shuts down. </h2><br>
      <p class="txt"> As you look around in confusion, you hear a ticking sound but you have no idea where its coming from. Little do you know, you've just activated several nuclear codes.
        <br>
        After frantically trying to to reboot the computer, the power cuts off in the office and the mysterious ticking finally stops.
        <br>
        After a few seconds a bright light flashes before your eyes. </p>
    <p id="end"> Congratulations, You just blew up the planet. </p>
